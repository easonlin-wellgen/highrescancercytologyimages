
I. Brief Description
	These are cancer cytology images captured by high-resolution (1928x1208) and high-magnification (450x) medical microscope systems from real-world specimens. They were mainly from pleural effusion and ascitic fluids of cancer patients. We would like to offer this image set as open data and call on all AI scientists in the world to join cancer detection. This is the first set (approx. 5,000 images) of a large data set (>5 million classified images).

II. Clinical Background and Implications
	Serous fluid cytopathology is crucial in diagnosing and managing various malignancies, particularly in metastatic cancers. Examining cellular components in serous effusions, including pleural, peritoneal, and pericardial fluids, provides valuable insights into the presence and nature of neoplastic processes. However, the traditional cytological examination of serous fluids relies heavily on the expertise of trained cytopathologists to identify and characterize cellular abnormalities. This process is inherently subjective and can be influenced by cytologist experience, specimen quality, and the often subtle morphological changes associated with malignancy. Moreover, serous effusions' low cellularity and heterogeneous nature further complicate the diagnostic process, potentially leading to missed diagnoses or false-positive results. Thus, accurately identifying atypical or malignant cells in serous fluid specimens remains a significant challenge in clinical practice, often requiring extensive expertise and time-consuming manual evaluation. 

	In recent years, the application of AI and machine learning in pathology has shown promising results in various domains, including histopathology and radiology. These technologies have demonstrated the potential to augment human expertise, improve diagnostic accuracy, and streamline workflow efficiency. Integrating digital pathology and whole slide imaging (WSI) has opened new avenues for enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of general pathology examinations. However, conventional WSI scanning technologies, primarily designed for histology specimens, often fall short of capturing the intricate details necessary for accurate cytological assessment. The limitations of traditional scanning methods, such as insufficient resolution and inadequate z-stack capabilities, underscore the need for specialized imaging solutions tailored to the unique requirements of cytopathology. Another obstacle in applying machine learning to cytopathology is the significant class imbalance in cytological specimens. In serous effusions, atypical or malignant cells often represent a small fraction of the total cellular population, making it challenging to develop robust and generalizable AI models using traditional supervised learning approaches. This imbalance necessitates innovative strategies to overcome the limitations of conventional machine learning paradigms. Furthermore, the labor-intensive and time-consuming process of manually annotating cytology images for AI model training poses a significant barrier to the widespread adoption of these technologies in clinical practice. Developing label-free approaches that can effectively learn from unlabeled data could address this challenge and facilitate the scalable implementation of AI-assisted cytopathology.

	In light of these challenges and opportunities, our study aims to establish a novel approach to enhancing the detection of atypical cells in serous fluid cytopathology by synergistically applying advanced imaging technologies and innovative AI algorithms.

III. Image Data Information
	To address the objective, we employed a commercial microscopy system (CytoScan, Wellgen Medical, Kaohsiung, USFDA listing 2024) as the slide scanner capable of capturing high-resolution images at 450x or 900x magnification. This proprietary inverted microscope system was originally designed for sputum smears to detect acid-fast TB bacillus. The imaging system allows for the acquisition of detailed cytological images using filed-by-field autofocus that surpasses the capabilities of traditional slide scanners. In this study, we used 450x as our magnification power for all case smears. Each field of view was captured at 1,928 x 1,208 (pixel) image resolution at a physical size of 565 x 354 um2 (each pixel is 0.293 x 0.293 um2).
